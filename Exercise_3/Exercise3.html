		<p class="name">Elizabeth Holmes</p>
		
		<p> My name is Elizabeth Holmes, former founder and CEO of Theranos and current felon awaiting sentencing for conspiracy to commit wire fraud. </p>
		
		<p>I was born in Washington, D.C. in 1984, but spent most of my childhood in Houston, TX before moving to Palo Alto, CA to study chemical engineering at Stanford University. </p>
		
		<p class="narrow"> I quickly dropped out of Stanford after filing my first patent for a wearable drug-delivery patch. It didn't work. I later filed patents for machines that could accurately diagnose diseases from a single drop of blood. Those also didn't work. </p>
		
		<p class="narrow">Along the way, I wore a lot of black turtlenecks and drank a lot of green juice. I also defrauded notable public figures including Betsy DeVos, Henry Kissinger, Jim Mattis, and George Shultz. </p>
		
		<p class="narrow">I am also a newlywed, new mother, and anticpating a 20 year prison sentence.</p>
